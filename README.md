# About this Project

Python TextBot is a collection of scripts I wrote to simplify aspects of my life such as remembering birthdays and homework assignments. By using the [PyTextNow package](https://pypi.org/project/PyTextNow/) I am able to communiacte with my Raspberry Pi using basic commands in order to receive responses.

## How to Use

There is a wide range of commands, here are a few of them:
