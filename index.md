        Python TextBot is a comprehensive automation system that uses a collection of scripts to simplify various aspects of daily life. The bot sends automated text reminders for birthdays and homework assignments, and responds to slash commands for accessing real-time information like news, weather, and memes.

    <p class='text-base font-normal text-gray-500 sm:text-lg dark:text-gray-400'>
        Built using the PyTextNow package for SMS communication, the system runs on a Raspberry Pi and processes incoming text messages to provide desired information and reminders automatically.
